# progressive-law-petitions
Here's you can find some progressive ideas according to new laws to be proposed like petitions you can create on any democratic government sites.

- the science people payments should be set as or more than politics people, cause they will spend that money mainly in new researches, but not on food and clothes etc.
- each government person must be sertificated with 2-3 independent psychiater tests (better if in several countries) before doing a job to prevent general vulnerabilities according to gathered 'power' you will have on the job place.
- gevernment people should not have regular payments more than [minimal payment] * 1.20-1.30 across the country - that will help to increase minimal life limits and provide next steps problems.
- the days after today depends only from the things done for today and past days ago. Must be set general rules across the country for children education (school\home) to grow up unique persons, but with similar thoughts in their minds such as equality, brotherhood. Children should have their own way, not the easiest way according to parents thougths, cause in result you will have parasites for humanity that doing nothing only.
- for ecology improving situation must be penalties send as for each plastic \ glass item was found on the grass, in a forest etc. If you have money from the goods - spend some of them to have Earth as clean too.
Each country must have school subjects as brotherhood, equality and helping close to you people in wrong situation.
- the effectiveness of treatment should depends on not from the number of patients per day, but from the specific form that each patient fills out about the quality of services he has here. Information is collected and salaries are paid like invoices.
- It is impossible to usurp all around your country area and all around waiting for some magic things that everything will be fine from that - no! It's wasn't nowhere yet from the history. Global decision-making system - should always be like a mechanism that includes at least two responsible people (that are independent). Also their actions must be approved by people's delegates or parlament (people that were elected to present interests of people, not their personal businesses. These people must not "promote themselves").
- Imagine if two countries have cross-government? - Really inovative idea! Like let's switch governments for 3m, for example and let's see what was better or not.
- If the most stupid (or around that) people will rule the world you will have all the things to pay only cause their 'decisions tree' is so limited in their minds and 
how to solve the issue for example, with trash throwers on the streets - all that you need is providing correctional labor instead fines. Put a video camera to wathc what this person is doing and assign some part of a city to he \ she can clean it up and she \ he will have a few hours when it is possible to think about the sence of throwing thash around. Just thinks about! We have a fine for thrash throw around <10$ and to sign it you should have a provement that it was really throwed by the person, then you must go with that to the local police, find the person .. It's impossible to even <10$ collect from the person, but even if you did it - he \ she will say you: OK, <10$? - not a problem, take it. Instead this person must work for 1 week as free on that city cleaning purposes and that will be right solution for that.
- регулярные экскурсии для детей и студентов на городские мусорные полиноны (свалки отходов) для общего понимания, что ждет их поколение в случае ведение такого же образа жизни, как сейчас
- идея гос. регулятор ценовых политик на все основные производимые товары или услуги для мониторинга спекуляций в которой каждый может проверить актуальную цену на товар\услугу в среднем: мониторинг цен должен включать в себя некоторую логику расчета среднего ценового показателя на едницу чего-то исходя из составляющих затрат на его производство\осуществление, если этот показатель расчитаный компетентным органом выше чем 20% - повод произвести проверку на спекуляцию.
